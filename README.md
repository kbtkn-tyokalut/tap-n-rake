#### Customizable data-extraction engine for Wireshark's HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 JSON packet syntax.

Snap the packet capture on, browse through the target, export the pcap json data for the program. 
Everything (down to the link level if necessary) is extractable - nothing quite like tapping into a network 
interface and fine-grainedly raking through the tens of megabytes of pure pcap data. 

Initial prototyping release AKA just-wrote-the-first-version-and-won't-bother-providing-a-user-guide-yet -phase 15/02 
Alpha release target (including user guide!) by the end of February.
